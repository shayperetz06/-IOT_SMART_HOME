# Printer Alert

This project is part of a C.S department course assignment.

The product we chose to develop is a Printer Alert for private people, businesses, etc. that will help them to manage the amount of prints.

## Description

Many times people need to print some documents and find out the printer is out of ink, Or multiple times people change ink ahead of time and spend money and pollute the environment more.

Our product come to prevent all of this.

First of all, 
The app will alert you how many pages can be printed and how much ink is left.

Second, the app will alert you when the ink is about to run out.

In addition, the app will alert you when more than a hundred pages have been printed in order to keep the printer properly maintained.
